This is a "guide" for using [XMR Bazaar](https://xmrbazaar.com) to purchase items via Amazon wishlists. You can earn non-KYC Monero by purchasing items. And get a discount by spending Monero for Amazon items.

The ultimate goal is to integrate steps in this guide into XMR Bazaar to make ordering from Amazon using XMR easier, and make this guide obsolete.

You can use this guide today to manually create Amazon Wishlists, and XMR Bazaar listings to purchase items. And earn non-KYC Monero by purchasing Amazon items and "selling" (drop ship) directly to XMR Bazaar users.
