This is a "guide" to using XMR Bazaar for purchasing via Amazon wishlists.

The ultimate goal is to integrate the steps in this guide into XMR Bazaar and more easily allow ordering from Amazon using XMR, and provide a non-KYC option to earn Monero by purchasing items via Amazon using XMRBazaar.com.

It's possible today. You can manually create listings for Amazon on XMRBazaar and purchase on Amazon to earn Monero.
